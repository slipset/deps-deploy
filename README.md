# deps-deploy

A Clojure library to deploy your stuff to clojars with `clj` or `clojure`. It's a very thin wrapper around
Chas Emericks [pomegranate](https://github.com/clj-commons/pomegranate) library.

It will read your Clojars username/token from the environment variables `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD`, and it will get your artifact-name and version from the `pom.xml`

## Usage

To deploy to Clojars, simply merge

```clojure
{:deploy {:extra-deps {slipset/deps-deploy {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
          :main-opts ["-m" "deps-deploy.deps-deploy" "deploy"
		      "path/to/my.jar"]}}
```
into your `deps.edn`, have a `pom.xml` handy (you can generate one with `clj -Spom`), and deploy with

```sh
$ env CLOJARS_USERNAME=username CLOJARS_PASSWORD=clojars-token clj -A:deploy
```

to deploy to Clojars.

It is also possible to override the default Clojars URL by supplying your own. For example:

```sh
$ env CLOJARS_URL=https://internal/repository/maven-releases CLOJARS_USERNAME=username CLOJARS_PASSWORD=password clj -A:deploy
```

This facilitates deploying artefacts to an internal repository - perhaps a proxy service that is running locally that is used
to hold private JARs etc...

### A note on Clojars tokens

As of 2020-06-27, Clojars will no longer accept your Clojars password when deploying. You will have to use a token instead.
Please read more about this [here](https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Deploy-Tokens)

Long story short, just go find yourself a token and use it in lieu of your password and you're done.

## Install locally

`deps-deploy` also supports installing to your local `.m2` repo, by invoking `install` instead of `deploy`:
```clojure
{:install {:extra-deps {slipset/deps-deploy {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
           :main-opts ["-m" "deps-deploy.deps-deploy" "install"
			   "path/to/my.jar"]}}
```

## Signing

If you want to have your artifacts signed, add `"true"` as the last element of the `:main-opts` vector like so:
```clojure
:main-opts ["-m" "deps-deploy.deps-deploy" "install"
			   "path/to/my.jar" "true"]
 ```
